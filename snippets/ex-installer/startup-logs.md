You can easily save the serial console logs (also referred to as startup logs) by clicking the `Save Log` button.

![Save logs](/_static/images/ex-installer/save-logs.png){ width=50% }

You can manually type the location where you wish to save the logs, or use the `Browse` button to select a folder, for example your desktop:

![Save logs](/_static/images/ex-installer/save-logs-desktop.png){ width=50% }

Once selected, click the `Save and open log` button to save to the chosen location and view them:

![Device logs](/_static/images/ex-installer/device-logs.png){ width=50% }

The generated log filename will start with "device-logs-" and have a timestamp appended, for example "device-logs-20251230-092907.log".

Note that while the screen shots above are taken on Windows, the same steps apply to both Linux and macOS.
