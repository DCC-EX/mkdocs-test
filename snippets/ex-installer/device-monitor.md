EX-Installer's Device Monitor can be used to interact with your devices via their serial console or interface.

You can access Device Monitor from the "Select your device" page after choosing your device from the list:

![Select your device - open device monitor](/_static/images/ex-installer/select-device-open-device-monitor.png){ width=50% }

Alternatively, once you have successfully loaded the software onto your device, you can access Device Monitor on the "Load" page:

![Load software - open device monitor](/_static/images/ex-installer/load-open-device-monitor.png){ width=50% }

When the Device Monitor window opens, you will see all output from your device in the main window.

To interact with your device, enter commands in the provided "Enter command" box and either press ++enter++ or click the `Send` button. There is also a handy pulldown arrow you can use to repeat a previously entered command to save on typing again.

Note that the Device Monitor indicates the device you have selected which is handy in case you have multiple devices connected.

Note that while the screen shots above are taken on Windows, the same steps apply to both Linux and macOS.
