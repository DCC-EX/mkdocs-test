# Command Station Internal Architecture

==TODO==

![Code structure](/_static/images/ex-commandstation/command-station-arch.svg)

This diagram is old but basically ok. Needs editing to

- Do better at css dark/light
- TPL renamed to EXRAIL
- have hotlinks on boxes to the relevant adres of the doc and/or the actual code modules in git.
- maybe convert to mermaid.
