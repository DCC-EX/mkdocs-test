- Once installed, open **EX‑Toolbox** and it will go through the initial setup wizard where it will ask for one permission, and for which which theme you would like to use.

- After you complete the setup wizard, you will be shown the 'Connection' Screen.

## Connecting to your Command Station

Please remember that to connect to a Wifi device running in AP mode, you must switch your phone or tablet Wifi to the correct access point.

Other than the very first time you start **EX‑Toolbox**, when the app opens you will be shown the 'Connection' screen.

There are three ways you can select a EX‑CommandStation to connect to:

- ``IP Address and Port`` <br/>
  To find your EX-CommandStation's IP address and Port refer you original setup or, if you have a OLED screen on your command station the details will be displayed on it.
  The port will normally be 2560.

- ``Discovered Servers`` <br/>
  If the server you want to connect to is in the list, simply click on it and you will be taken to the 'CV-Programming' screen.

- ``Recent servers`` <br/>
  If the server does not appear in the recent list try one of the other two methods. Your server not appearing in the recent list is not necessarily a problem and there can be a number of reasons why.

## Important

**EX‑Toolbox** can only connect directly to an EX‑CommandStation or JMRI's 'DCC++ over TCP Server', however JMRI, the EX‑CommandStation and other devices and apps can, or do, advertise as "WiThrottle"”" mDNS services. EX-Toolbox cannot determine which are actually direct connections to an EX‑CommandStation or JMRI's 'DCC++ over TCP Server'.

If you only ever connect to one EX‑CommandStation you can effectively bypass this screen by setting the 'Auto-Connect to WiThrottle Server?' preference.
