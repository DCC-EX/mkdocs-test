# Semaphore (servo) Signals

Semaphore signals may be driven by servos under the control of EXRAIL. (Some semaphore signals have DCC decoders and their own movement mechanism)

To define a servo based signal, it is necessary to experiment to obtain the correct servo angles. Always do this without the serveo mechanically connected to the signal as servos are capable of serious damage. Use the SERVO_SIGNAL macro.
