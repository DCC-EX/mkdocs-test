# DC Mode - PWM Frequency

The default PWM frequency is 131Hz.  Functions F29-F30-F31 are defined to enable other frequencies.

The functions will toggle the bits ON/OFF as shown in the table.

**NOTE:**

- The frequency does not change until a powerON command is sent.

- Tracks are assigned to timers.  Throttles are assigned to tracks.  
  Changing the frequency for one throttle will impact all tracks assigned to the same timer.
