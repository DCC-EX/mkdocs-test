# Keeping EXRAIL commands in multiple files

EXRAIL commands are read by the compiler only from the file myAutomation.h, the absence of a file with this name means no EXRAIL code is loaded into the command station.

However, it is simple to partition myAutomation.h into separate files for the convenience of editing. 
For example myTurnouts.h, myRoster.h and so on. By ensuring all the files start with "my" it avoids issues with name clashes or Git.

To include your additional files, use the c++ preprocessor #include control 
in myAutomation.h to insert the file contents exactly as if you had typed them
into myAutomation.h

```cpp
// Include my roster file
#include "myRoster.h"
// Include my turnout definitions
#include "myTurnouts.h"
// Special animation
#include "myCowOnElectricFence.h"
```
