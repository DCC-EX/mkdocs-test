# Help and Support

At some point you will likely need to get some help or support for our products, and the available methods are outlined on this page.

**NOTE** For users of hardware products purchased from resellers, in the event of a hardware issue please contact the reseller in the first instance. Each reseller is responsible for supporting the hardware they sell.

Please note that the DCC-EX team are all volunteers and are distributed globally, so while we endeavour to help as much and as quickly as we can, all support is provided on a best-effort basis only, and there will be times where no team members are available.

This is why we strongly recommend Discord as the best source of support, because there is a global community of over 4,000 users, some of whom may be able to help before a DCC-EX team member is online.

## Information required for support queries

When requesting support for any of our products, there is some critical information you must provide in order for us to be able to help you. As volunteers, our time is limited and therefore the more information you can provide up front, the quicker we can help you resolve any issues rather than spend valuable time repeating requests for missing information.

This is the information typically required:

- The product and version
- The exact hardware in use
- Upload serial/console logs
- Upload all configuration files for the software in use
- Detail any troubleshooting steps you have already performed

### Product and Version

```console
<s>
```

### Get startup logs

## Discord (recommended)

Our strongly recommended support option is the DCC-EX Discord server, where you can interact directly with the DCC-EX team as well as a global community of over 4,400 users. Issues are usually resolved quite quickly in comparison with the other options, and you can also interact with the community in real-time.

Please refer to our [Discord page](/support/05-discord.md) which outlines how to join our Discord server, interact with the community, and how to raise support tickets.

## GitHub

If you are an existing GitHub user, you can also get support via GitHub which is particularly useful for bug reports. While all the DCC-EX team members have GitHub accounts and can respond, this is typically not as quick as getting support via our recommended Discord server option.

Please refer to our [GitHub page](/support/02-github.md) on the various repositories you can raise issues in.

## TrainBoard

If you're a member of the TrainBoard forum, there is a [DCC++ Forum](https://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?forums/dcc.177/) you can post in for help. Yes, it is still called DCC++.

Note that this isn't the busiest forum and only a few of the DCC-EX team are members of TrainBoard, so resolution of issues may be slow. There are other members of the forum that may try to assist though.

## Email (not recommended)

While email support is available for those who have no other way to obtain support, there is only one team member with access to reply to your queries, and therefore ***this is a slow process and is not recommended.***

If necessary, you can email us at <support@dcc-ex.com>.
