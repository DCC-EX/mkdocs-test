# WeMos D1 R32 + EX8874

Refer to [Complex Build - ESP32](/diy/40-esp32.md) for a general overview.  
The information below may help explain how to overcome some of the complexities when using the  

## WiFi reliability

![WeMos R1 D32 IOREF](/_static/images/esp32/wemos-ioref-label.png){ width=20% align=right}

- Solder a 250 to 330 ohms resistor, GPIO_0 to 3.3V, for reliable WiFi when using the WeMos D1 R32 ESPDuino-32.

## IOREF voltage

- Do not confuse adding the resistor to correct high voltage on GPIO_0 with the need to work around the incorrect voltage of the IOREF pin.
- From top to bottom the pins are: IO0, 5V (incorrect - **IOREF should be 3.3V** - so not Arduino Uno R3 compliant), RESET, 3.3V, 5V, GND, GND, VIN as seen here:

- Note that some ESPDuino-32 boards may not have the IOREF pin location labelled. Measure the voltage if in doubt.  
- As the IOREF pin on the WeMos D1 R32 is 5V, modify the EX8874 using the **3V3 IOREF Override** solder pad on the EX8874. If this is not done, the ADC inputs will receive up to 5V when the IOREF pin is 5V.
- Bend the IOREF pin or confirm that the trace connecting the pin is completely cut.

Review of **motor shield define** from MotorDrivers.h for ESP32 WeMos R1 D32

```cpp
  #elif defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_ESP32)  
  // STANDARD shield on an ESPDUINO-32 (ESP32 in Uno form factor). The shield must be eiter the  
  // 3.3V compatible R3 version or it has to be modified to not supply more than 3.3V to the  
  // analog inputs. Here we use analog inputs A2 and A3 as A0 and A1 are wired in a way so that  
  // they are not useable at the same time as WiFi (what a bummer). The numbers below are the  
  // actual GPIO numbers. In comments the numbers the pins have on an Uno.  
  #define STANDARD_MOTOR_SHIELD F("STANDARD_MOTOR_SHIELD"), \  
    new MotorDriver(25/* 3*/, 19/*12*/, UNUSED_PIN, 13/*9*/, 35/*A2*/, 0.70, 1500, UNUSED_PIN), \  
    new MotorDriver(23/*11*/, 18/*13*/, UNUSED_PIN, 12/*8*/, 34/*A3*/, 0.70, 1500, UNUSED_PIN)  

  // EX 8874 based shield connected to a 3.3V system (like ESP32) and 12bit (4096) ADC  
  // numbers are GPIO numbers. comments are UNO form factor shield pin numbers  
  #define EX8874_SHIELD F("EX8874"),\  
    new MotorDriver(25/* 3*/, 19/*12*/, UNUSED_PIN, 13/*9*/, 35/*A2*/, 1.27, 5000, 36 /*A4*/), \  
    new MotorDriver(23/*11*/, 18/*13*/, UNUSED_PIN, 12/*8*/, 34/*A3*/, 1.27, 5000, 39 /*A5*/)  
```

- STANDARD_MOTOR_SHIELD and EX8874_SHIELD are pre-defined for use with ESP32 in MotorDrivers.h
- **Do not edit MotorDrivers.h**; a custom motor define must be added in your config.h only
- Note how the ESP32 GPIO pin numbers are used, and the Arduino pin locations are shown/commented.

Alternate pins A2 and A3 are required for the WeMos D1 R32 / ESPDuino-32.

One EX8874 motor shield would use the motor define EX8874_SHIELD, and update the solder pads to use A2 and A3.

When one EX8874 motor shield is used with WeMos R1 D32 ESPDuino-32, the alternate current sense pins are used as the A0 and A1 pin locations cannot be used as ADC input when WiFi is enabled.

### Single EX8874 Checklist

- [ ] Cover the barrel connector on WeMos R1 D32, as VIN power will be provided by EX8874
- [ ] Add resistor for WiFi reliability - GPIO_0 to 3v3
- [ ] IOREF Override set to 3v3
- [ ] Confirm that IOREF pin is bent or trace is cut
- [ ] Alternate pins enabled via solder pads
- [ ] `#define MOTOR_SHIELD_TYPE EX8874_SHIELD` on one line in config.h

## Stacked EX8874

- **IOREF:** The IOREF override is also needed for the top shield.
- **VIN:** Refer to instructions on [cutting the VIN trace and disabling the regulator](/products/ex-motorshield8874/00-ex-motorshield8874.md/#steps-to-stack) for the top shield.
- Stacking motor shields on WeMos D1 R32 ESPDuino-32 requires a combination of solder pads and complex wiring.
  Note the location of GPIO pins 15 and 33 (image above), where wires or right-angle header pins will need to be installed on the WeMos R1 D32 ESPDuino-32.

- A custom motor define will be needed in config.h

```cpp
  #define EX8874_SHIELDX2 F("EX8874_SHIELDX2"), \  
    new MotorDriver(25/* 3*/, 19/*12*/, UNUSED_PIN, 13/*9*/, 35/*A2*/, 1.52, 5000, 15), \  
    new MotorDriver(23/*11*/, 18/*13*/, UNUSED_PIN, 12/*8*/, 34/*A3*/, 1.52, 5000, 33), \  
    new MotorDriver(26/* 2*/,  5/*10*/, UNUSED_PIN, 14/*7*/, 36/*A4*/, 1.52, 5000, 2 /*A0*/), \  
    new MotorDriver(16/* 5*/, 17/* 4*/, UNUSED_PIN, 27/*6*/, 39/*A5*/, 1.52, 5000, 4 /*A1*/)  
  #define MOTOR_SHIELD_TYPE EX8874_SHIELDX2
```

### Stacked EX8874 Checklist

- [ ] Cover the barrel connector on WeMos R1 D32, as VIN power will be provided by one EX8874  
- [ ] Add resistor for WiFi reliability  
- [ ] IOREF Override set to 3v3 on both EX8874 boards  
- [ ] Confirm that IOREF pin is bent or trace is cut  
- [ ] VIN trace cut and regulator disabled on top EX8874  
- [ ] Alternate pins enabled via solder pads  
- [ ] Complex wiring added  
- [ ] Jumpers added for GPIO 15 and 33  
- [ ] Add the custom motor define - 6 lines in config.h
