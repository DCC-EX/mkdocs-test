# Glossary of Terms

These are common terms used throughout our documentation.

If you wish to see where a term is used, click the term name to search for it.

## Turnout (Point/Switch)

[Search for turnout](?turnout)

In a prototypical railway, a turnout allows a train to diverge from one track to another. In DCC-EX terms, this term also denotes a software object that can control a physical turnout on your layout. A turnout can also be referred to as a point or a switch.

Depending on your region, turnouts are also commonly referred to as points or switches.

## Roster

[Search for roster](?roster)

A roster is a list of locomotives that are known in advance by the command station so that DCC addresses, name, and functions can be used by throttles to configure buttons etc.  

## VPIN

[Search for VPIN](?VPIN)

A VPIN is an Arduino pin number that has been extended to include pins on external devices or expanders. Once the mapping of VPIN numbers to devices has been done, the commands that set or test pins do not have to care how the electronics works.

## Pullup

[Search for pullup](?pullup)

The term pullup within the context of DCC-EX is commonly used when discussing inputs or sensors along with other topics such as I2C cabling. This is an electronics focused term, typically referring to the use of a resistor to ensure an input/sensor or I2C line is pulled up or held to a specific voltage (typically 3.3V or 5V).

## Pulldown

[Search for pulldown](?pulldown)

The term pulldown within the context of DCC-EX is commonly used when discussing inputs or sensors along with other topics such as I2C cabling. This is an electronics focused term, typically referring to the use of a resistor to ensure an input/sensor or I2C line is pulled down or held to ground or 0V.

You will also see search results for using a pulldown menu, but that is a different context!
