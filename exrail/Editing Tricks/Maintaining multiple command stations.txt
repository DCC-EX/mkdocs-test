# Maintaining multiple command stations

Maybe you have more than one command station and you wish to have slightly different EXRAIL 
setups, perhaps because you are testing a new release on a sepaerate CPU or need to compile different scripts for different layouts.

The C++ compiler pre-processor is available to select various parts of your myAutomation.h based on definitions created in your config.h or those created by defines.he which automates the detection of the CPU type of your command station. 

For example:
```
#if defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_AVR)
  // on my Mega, I have signal1 on pins (30,31,32)
  ALIAS(mysignal1,30)
#else 
  // on my CSB1 or similar, I use pins 800,801,802 on an expander
  ALIAS(mysignal1,800)
#endif
  SIGNALH(mysignal1,mysignal1+1,mysignal1+2)
  ONTHROW(1) RED(mysignal1) DONE
  ONCLOSE(1) GREEN(mysignal1) DONE
  ```


In addition, each EXRAIL command is actually a preprocessor definition so it is possible to use an #ifdef to include a section that uses a new feature but only if the code version has that feature available.

```
#ifdef NEOPIXEL
   NEOPIXEL(2013,255,255,0)
#endif   
```

Note #ifdef xxx and #if defined(xxx) do the same thing.
