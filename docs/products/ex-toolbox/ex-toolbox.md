# EX-Toolbox - Overview

**EX‑Toolbox** is a free, open source, Android app to help setup and configure your **EX‑CommandStation**. It is intended for setup, configuration, debugging your Command Station rather than continuous use.

It is designed to function if your **EX‑CommandStation** is configured with WiFi (either Access Point mode or Station mode) or Ethernet. However:

- While it can't normally connect to a **EX‑CommandStation** through **JMRI**, it is possible if you *'Load DCC++ over TCP Server'* in the 'DCC-EX' menu in **JMRI**, then connect **EX‑Toolbox** to the additional server that is presented.

- While it can't normally connect to an **EX‑CommandStation** though USB, there some options that can allow this to work partly. See [Connecting via USB for details](connect_wifi_throttle_via_usb_not_in_nav.md).

- While **EX‑Toolbox** normally needs to be installed on your phone or tablet, it may be installed on Windows PC under a suitable Android emulator. Refer to the [Installation Guide](installation-guide.md#installing-ex-toolbox-on-ms-windows-macos)
