# EX-CSB1 in DCC Booster Mode

The EX-CSB1 can be configured as a DCC Booster.  As a booster it can take input from any DCC Command Station, not just an EX-CommandStation, to provide additional two power districts to your layout.  With the addition of an EX-MotorShield8874, it can provide up to 4 power districts.

To configure the EX-CSB1 as a DCC Booster, you will need to install the EX-CommandStation software on it with the addition of the following commands to the ``myAutomation.h`` file:

```c++
AUTOSTART
  SET_TRACK(A,"BOOST")
  SET_TRACK(B,"BOOST")
  DONE
```

If you are using an EX-CSB1 with an EX-MotorShield8874 as your booster you will need to add the following commands to the myAutomation.h file:

```c++
AUTOSTART
  SET_TRACK(A,"BOOST")
  SET_TRACK(B,"BOOST")
  SET_TRACK(C,"BOOST")
  SET_TRACK(D,"BOOST")
  DONE
```

You also need to add these two lines to the ``config.h`` file:

```c++
#define WIFI_LED 33
#define BOOSTER_INPUT 32
```

You will then need to connect a ``MAIN`` output from your command station to the Railsync connector on the EX-CSB1 Booster.  The EX-CSB1 Booster will then provide power to the rails on the A and B outputs.  If you are using an EX-MotorShield8874, it will also provide power to the rails on the C and D outputs.

If you are using an EX-CSB1 as your Command Station, it is recommended that you use one of the outputs as the dedicated output to the EX-CSB1 Booster. If you use the output to the booster, as well as to a block of track, a short or overload on that block will cause the EX-CSB1 Booster to also kill power to all of its outputs.

!!! note "Output configuration options"

    The outputs can be configured as:

    - ``BOOST`` - Booster mode
    - ``BOOST_INV`` - Booster mode inverted
    - ``BOOST_AUTO`` - Booster mode + Auto-reverser mode
