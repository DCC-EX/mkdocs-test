# XL9535 Relay Board

The XL9535 devices have varying numbers of relays and are easier to wire than having to have separate relays connected to an IO Expander (such as MCP23017 or PCA/TCA9555)

Driver definition is by a HAL command in myAutomation.h (or files it includes) 

```cpp
HAL(XL9535, firstVpin, NumberOfRelays, i2cAddress)
```
