# EX-Toolbox - Overview

**EX‑Toolbox** is a free, open source, Android app to help setup and configure your EX‑CommandStation. It is intended for setup, configuration, debugging your Command Station rather than continuous use.

It is designed to function if your EX‑CommandStation is configured with WiFi (either Access Point mode or Station mode) or Ethernet.

It can't normally connect to a EX‑CommandStation through JMRI, however it is possible if you *'Load DCC++ over TCP Server'* in the 'DCC-EX' menu in JMRI, then connect **EX‑Toolbox** to the additional server that is presented.

It can't normally connect to a EX‑CommandStation though USB, however there some options that can allow this to work partly. See [Connecting via USB for details](connect_wifi_throttle_via_usb.md).

**EX‑Toolbox** is installed on you phone or tablet from the Play Store. It may be installed on windows under a suitable Android simulator. Refer to the [Installation Guide](installation-guide.md)
