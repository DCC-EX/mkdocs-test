DCC-EX comes ready-equipped with the capability to add many such devices. In the hands of users experienced in electronics, DCC-EX can support hundreds of such devices using a connection system called I2C \u201cI Squared C\u201d which is built-into your Command Station. While I2C is very powerful, it is not a consumer plug and play set up. If you have not used it before and are not experienced in electronics, you will need to teach yourself some new skills \u2013 which can be fun and which also creates its own challenges.</p> <p>To help Conductors to get up the learning curve, we have 3 proven and essential building blocks that will get you there as smoothly as possible. We ask new users to closely follow all 3 of these, as otherwise our volunteer support teams get overwhelmed with support requests as the success of the DCC-EX venture grows.</p> <p>The 3 I2C building blocks we very strongly request Conductors build for themselves are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Firstly, we have developed a set of tightly-specified components and configurations that we know work well in practice. Yes, you can often find cheaper individual components but these are a false economy as they are often poorly manufactured, meaning they may not work at all, causing frustration and a non-functioning model train layout. Please use these configurations initially, so that you can get used to the I2C system before becoming more adventurous.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secondly, there are new skills to learn and new terms to become familiar with if you are to be able to understand why your own set up is or is not working. You will hear terms like pullup resistors, logic voltage level, clock and data lines bandied about. Some of these you\u2019ll need to understand well, others can wait. Self-education on I2C therefore is vital for Conductors to enjoy your deployment of I2C from the very beginning. We have curated a number of videos and guides that we know to be helpful. There is even a foundation set that we strongly urge new users to watch, so that you understand the basics of I2C.</p> </li> <li> <p>Third, even when using a configuration that is known to work, you will be using a number of cables to connect items and it is very common to have problems caused by inadvertently swapping cables, or simply poor connections, which can cause things not to work, or worse, be damaged. The use of a multimeter to confirm correct set up and to troubleshoot any issues arising is mission critical. Yes, we are strong on this point because it is such a vital tool for you to enjoy this aspect of your hobby and for our support teams to guide you through any problems you may encounter.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Using these 3 proven building blocks together, you will likely have a successful installation. If you choose to ignore these, you will probably find a multitude of unexpected and unknown issues and join the ranks of users that can\u2019t get their accessories to work and don\u2019t understand why.</p>"},{"location":"products/ex-commandstation/accessories/89-i2c-wiring/","title":"I2C Wiring","text":"<p>I2C expansion modules provide accessory pins, but I2C wiring requires a lot of attention to detail.</p>"},{"location":"products/ex-commandstation/accessories/89-i2c-wiring/#i2c-concepts","title":"I2C concepts","text":"<ul> <li>Keep I2C wiring short.</li> <li>Use Qwiic cables.</li> <li>Know the combined resistance of connected I2C modules.</li> <li>Avoid using excess power from the microprocessor's power source.

It also calls on multiple software applications to address them. The initial software setup for an inexperienced tinkerer is consequently involved and needing perseverance. The Arduino IDE, the ESP32 libraries, the Processing 4 App, the EX-Command Station and EXRAIL (if used) combine to create a unique system supporting the sensorCAM's own software. Any prior knowledge of these will vastly expedite the installation.</p> <p>Outline:</p> <p>This installation process is divided into 12 steps outlined below. It is recommended that it be treated as a learning exercise and that testing of progress occur after each major step. For example, familiarization with Arduino IDE should be developed before moving to the ESP32 example, and then familiarize with the ESP32-CAM WiFi example before moving on to the sensorCAM loading.</p> <p>As the sensorCAM is not for Conductors, and perhaps only advanced Tinkerers, it is anticipated that users will already be familiar with the Arduino IDE and maybe already have toyed with the ESP32-CAM. We have not therefore included much detail on the first few steps but rather referred to existing documentation elsewhere (e.g. Arduino &amp; YouTube). Most detail is provided in steps 4 to 8 at this stage.</p> <p>The chapters of the full manual may be referred to where additional detail is sought. The 12 steps are:</p> <ol> <li>Check youtube video then acquire ESP32-CAM and MB/FTDI (OR ESP32-WROVER-DEV CAM)</li> <li>install Arduino IDE with the ESP32 libraries (includes a WiFi CAM example)</li> <li>Load the CAM with the WiFi example and test.</li> <li>Install the sensorCAM.ino software and configure.</li> <li>Test the basic sensorCAM functions to confirm functional install</li> <li>Load Processing 4 app. and sensorCAM.pde code</li> <li>Use the Processing 4 app to replace the Arduino Monitor. Further familiarise and test.</li> <li>With a fixed camera, create test sensors and test detection with moving targets.</li> <li>Setup the CAM viewing the model railroad and test a virtual sensor with moving rolling stock.</li> <li>Optimise parameters for best performance.</li> <li>Connect CAM to an i2c interface (e.g. PCA9515A or better)</li> <li>Depending on system, integrate sensorCAM into Command Station using appropriate code.</li> </ol> <p>Note: Check version of your CH340 driver in Device Manager - Ports. Change if issues arise.</p> <p>Recommended system USB driver is 3.5.2019.1 </p> <p>See Drivers for the CH340 for detailed instructions.</p> <p>Step 1. ESP-32 CAM</p> <p>To understand the animal, watch the video at ESP32 CAM - 10 Dollar Camera for IoT Projects - YouTube</p> <p>Be aware that you need a USB adapter and the ESP32-CAM-MB is preferred as it avoids hazards associated with a \"wired\" FTDI power where errors can easily result in CAM destruction. Programming is also easier. Acquire a CAM from your favourite source. Also be prepared for defective product so a spare CAM may be worthwhile. I have had 2 faulty ov2640 modules. ESP32-CAM version 1.9 is preferred (has GND/Reset pin) Purchasing ESP32-CAM-MB as a pair (MB &amp; CAM) is safest. Purchasing two pairs is insurance. Alternatively consider a new compatible ESP32-WROVER-CAM with simpler wiring (see Appendix &amp; sensorCAMmanual)</p> <p>Step 2. Install the Arduino IDE</p> <p>If you are not already familiar with this IDE (Integrated Development Environment), rather than go into details that are already covered in great detail on the Arduino web page, just follow the instructions in the following link Arduino IDE Guide and then return here.</p> <p>Step 2A. Install the IDE ESP32 libraries (including for ESP32-CAM).</p> <p>If you are new to ESP32, the board manager for ESP32 must be loaded. This is explained in the video at the 10minute mark. Note: WE MUST USE esp32 by Espressif. Select version 2.0.17 &amp; Install, NOT latest (3.1.x)</p> <p>Introduction to ESP32 - Getting Started - YouTube OR Installing - Arduino-ESP32 2.0.17 documentation</p> <p>OR follow the instructions on the official Espressif guide. again selecting version 2.0.17 to install.</p> <p>Step 3. Load and test the ESP32-CAM example</p> <p>Select the tools - board manager and the AI thinker ESP32 CAM. Then run the example as per YouTube at 9:30 minutes in. Run the ESP32 - camera - webserver example. Note: wifi uses 2.4GHz NOT a 5GHz wifi.</p> <p>ESP32 CAM - 10 Dollar Camera for IoT Projects - YouTube For problems with ESP32 connections refer to</p> <p>If you have an issue uploading to an EX-CSB1 - DCC-EX Model Railroading documentation</p> <p>Note: With the MB board there is a push button (IO0) that replaces the FTDI programming link. Hold the button in when powering up the CAM to initiate programming mode. With later versions of esp32-CAM the IO0 push button on the MB may not be needed. Ensure a Huge Partition Scheme is selected.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Step4. Install the sensorCAM</p> <ul> <li> <ol> <li>For v5.4.xx, Download the software zip to your PC from https://github.com/DCC-EX/EX-SensorCAM</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>For a \"devel\" version, rather than \"main\", select the later \"devel\" software (for CS v5.5.15 or higher)</p> <ul> <li> <ol> <li>Right click the zip and click Extract all. Browse to your Arduino sketches folder e.g. Documents/Arduino</li> </ol> </li> <li>Click Extract, creating new folder e.g. Documents/Arduino/EX-SensorCAM-main</li> <li>Rename EX-SensorCAM-main to sensorCAM</li> </ul> <p>The essential files for now are shown below. Other files may be used in later install steps.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <ol> <li>Using the configCAM.example.h as a guide, create and edit a configCAM.h to reflect your WiFi network name and password. Then with the correct com port and board selected, compile the sensorCAM.ino sketch. If all is well, load it into the CAM (replacing the ESP32 WiFi example)</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>Note: It may be necessary to use the MB IO0 button (or GPIO0 link) to get the CAM into upload mode.</p> <p>(refer back to video and/or Appendix below)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Step 5. Test the basic sensorCAM functions</p> <p>The sensorCAM has a suite of command codes with which you will need familiarity. Refer to the manual summary Appendix A or Chapter 5 (Configuration) for more detailed description. For now, open the Arduino monitor and the initialization procedure should scroll out. It requires that the monitor is set for \"115200 baud\" and \"NewLine\" (CR is unacceptable).</p> <p>After about 15 seconds you can enter the 'w' (wait) command into the monitor and the scrolling should pause. Another command such as 'i00' will give a relevant command response, or Enter alone will resume scrolling tabular output. The sensors still need configuring before they can work. Command 't1' will toggle the scrolling status data ON or OFF.</p> <p></p> <p>At this time a NEW CAM will have NO sensors set and is a clean slate needing meaningful configuration data. There may be a default sensor(S00) mid field (120,160). If all is well, this would be a good time to familiarize oneself with some commands starting with k10,50,80 to DEFINE your first sensor, followed by i10 to read info. on the new sensor S10 coordinates (50,80). Try a10 to enable sensor 10, quickly followed by w to \"wait\" scrolling of new sensor values. 't1' can be used to toggle ON/OFF the scrolling status data.</p> <p></p> <p>Then try a11,60,90 to DEFINE and ENABLE sensor 11. The 'p1' position pointer command should now list the new sensors and the \"difference\" score hopefully under 39 for any stable sensor provided the camera is fixed and pointing at a reasonably lit area.</p> <p></p> <p>An 'r00' command will take an internal reference photo for ALL sensors (including S10). Follow with 'w'.</p> <p></p> <p>An Enter should resume scrolling with live sensor states and a hand in front of the CAM may trip them (depending on lighting etc.). The w command will again pause scrolling. To save the new sensor settings in EPROM enter the 'e' command. You can undefine(erase) a sensor with 'u', redefine/relocate a sensor with 'a', inspect/interrogate a sensor with 'i', even display the digital (hex) values of pixels in sensor frame with 'f'. Refer to manual chapter 5 for more details on parameters, but do read Section 4.1 (Notation) first.</p> <p>Note: There are other (easier) ways to position new sensors. The coordinate method is best for \"tweaking\" positions by small amounts. Step 6 below leads to the preferable visual setting method.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 6. Load Processing 4</p> <p>The Arduino monitor is not \"visual\". The Processing 4 software enables one to see what the CAM sees and permits one to place sensors visually. Close down the Arduino IDE to free up the sensorCAM USB com port.</p> <p>Download the \"processing-4.3-windows-r64.zip\" file from https://processing.org</p> <p>Highlight the zip file and \"Extract all\" files to a suitable Destination directory (process4 say)</p> <p>Locate and make a shortcut to the processing-4.3/processing.exe file on the desktop.</p> <p>Make a sensorCAM folder in process4 &amp; Copy the sensorCAM.pde file into a process4/sensorCAM directory</p> <p>Click the shortcut thereby opening Processing4</p> <p>Click the GetStarted box on the Welcome window</p> <p>Click file-open, select sensorCAM.pde and open.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Click the (left) circular run button to produce the test pattern shown below</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>N.B. You may need to edit int comNo=1; if this is an inappropriate port. (see note below)</p> <p>Reposition and resize the Console window and test pattern to look like that below, wide enough to avoid line wrap-around. The Cmd: line space will be the text entry line to be used for the CAM commands previously used with Arduino monitor. The broad black Console space replaces the sensorCAM monitor display and the test pattern window is for image display and sensor positioning.</p> <p>Note the first lines of Console output. Choosing the first [0] COM port is the default. Should you have 2 (or more) COM ports listed, you may have to edit line 15: int comNo=0; to reflect your port the sensorCAM is attached to in the list (e.g. [1] as in image below). (Mac's typically show the port as /dev/cu.usbserial-xx)</p> <p>If the sensorCAM reboots and runs, enter cmd: w Enter or ver Enter which will suspend any scrolling and print the sensorCAM version. Use the scroll bar to view the top/bottom of the Console window. Note that you may have to click the mouse cursor on the Cmd: window before typing commands.</p> <p>Note the dark blue round icon on the taskbar will bring the image to the front should it vanish behind the Console window. The white round button to the right of \"Run\" will \"Stop\" the sensorCAM.pde program.</p> <p></p> <p>For convenience, locate sensorCAM/sensorCAM.pde and create a shortcut to this file on the desktop.</p> <p>Optionally, the file Users/[Barry]/AppData/Roaming/Processing/preferences.txt can be edited with a text editor (e.g. notepad) for more convenient startup of sensorCAM.pde. Depending on your screen resolution, for convenience, adjust the window.height.default=700 and window.width.default=1200 as below. This should ensure that the opening Processing 4 window is higher and wide enough to avoid undesirable line-wrapping of scrolling sensor state tabulation. You can adjust these settings later if 700x1200 is not optimum for your screen resolution and sensor count.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 7. Use the Processing 4 App to replace the Arduino monitor.</p> <p>The processing app. can communicate the same commands to the sensorCAM as used in Step 5 above.</p> <p>Proceed to verify the sensorCAM commands are generally working as before with Arduino IDE.</p> <p>New commands can now be explored to see still images from the CAM and to see location of defined sensors as small squares. Enter the command 'Y' at the Cmd: line and wait 15 seconds for a full image to appear. Remember the sensors after rebooting will be those last stored in EPROM, not last defined.</p> <p>To explore the imaging functions (W, X, Y, Z) in depth refer to the sensorCAM manual Chapter 6.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 8. Create test sensors and test detection with moving targets</p> <p>Create some test sensors using Processing 4 by typing Cmd: a31 (no Enter!) and following with a click on the image previously obtained as above. The command line will be completed with the cursor coordinates. Follow up with an Enter to define a new sensor S31. Verify the new sensor with a 'p3' command and SEE the new sensor with a new 'Y' command. Later versions \"box\" the new sensor automatically.</p> <p>The sensor squares on the image are colour coded with the b/s number using the standard resistor colour codes (refer manual Appendix E).</p> <p>Place a coloured object at the sensor position and observe the change in the scrolling tabulation for the sensor. Without the obstruction, after a reference command ('r00'), the difference score should be below 39 and with the obstruction the diff score should rise substantially. If the threshold is set ('t42' say) the sensor will \"trip\" and indicate occupied confirming successful installation. A moving hand test is an easy quick test to do.</p> <p>It is advisable to define a \"reference\" sensor S00 that will NOT be obstructed. Any trips of this sensor will indicate an unwanted change to the environment (e.g. lighting). To define such a sensor use a00 and a Processing 4 image \"click\" on a quiet location away from tracks but with \"good\" mid-range illumination</p> <p>(see Manual section 8.4). S00 is reserved and displayed separately at the left of the scrolling status table.</p> <p>Step 9. Setup the CAM viewing a railroad and test a virtual sensor with moving rolling stock.</p> <p>The CAM must be rigidly mounted, in a \"convenient\" location for testing at this stage. It may be limited by your cabling reach with USB control. Later, with buffered I2C and power, the sensorCAM may be able to be located more optimally.</p> <p>The Manual Chapter 5 covers many points of relevance to getting satisfactory detection. Review this chapter and test topics for clarification. Good familiarity leads to success. Initial tests should be with good contrast between track and rolling stock. Refine parameters later to handle more difficult targets.</p> <p>Step 10. Optimise parameters for best performance.</p> <p>Initially by trial &amp; error users will learn the significance of parameters. This is an Alpha release and consequently the default settings may not be best. Refer sensorCAM manual Appendix B.</p> <p>Step 11. Connect CAM to an i2c interface (e.g. PCA9515A or better)</p> <p>The quickest and simplest method is to fit a PCA9515A to the ESP32-CAM-MB. Refer to the manual Chapter 3, the pictures in the manual (Figure 7 and Appendix F). Level shifting (3.3V to 5V) for a Mega is the primary function of the PCA9515A. Adjust voltages if not 5V compliant (e.g. ESP32 Command Station). It has 10k pull-up resistors but extra may be needed. If distance is an issue, as the PCA9515A is limited to about 3metres, either an LTC4311A enhancer or a buffered i2c solution will be needed. The manual Ch. 7 &amp; Appendix F describes the PCA9515A used, but the Sparkfun differential Endpoint is also recommended.</p> <p>Step 12. Depending on system, integrate sensorCAM into Command Station using appropriate code.</p> <p>The CAM can be connected to a \"Control Station\" via i2c using appropriate host code (typically C++). It has been successfully interfaced to two different (Arduino Mega) systems but most focus has been on the DCC-EX-Command Station (CS). The sensorCAM can be connected to a CS and interrogated using EXRAIL.</p> <p>If you are wanting to integrate with a CS, we assume you have installed EX-CS previously. If not, refer to the DCC-EX website for details. The following guide assumes you have a working v5.4.x CS in place.</p> <p>12.1 The EX-SensorCAM repository has an EX-CS directory. These files normally reside with the CommandStation-EX.ino beside the other standard CS files. They are a guide to what is needed in the existing files in the _CommandStation-EX._ino directory. The user generally needs to EDIT existing files rather than copy these. The CamParser.cpp and IO_EXSensorCAM.h drivers already included in CS v5.4.x should be adequate for a \"Production/master\" CS installation, so do NOT copy these files from folder EX-CS unless they represent a known recommended upgrade to the integrated functions. It is advisable to make backups of any file you do need to edit in installing sensorCAM (12.2-12.5 below).</p> <p></p> <p>12.2 Edit CS config.h file adding #define SENSORCAM_VPIN 700 and #define CAM SENSORCAM_VPIN+ exactly as shown below for your first CAM. If you do NOT want to use vpins 700 to 779 for the sensorCAM virtual sensors, or use multiple sensorCAM's, you may adjust the vpin number accordingly. Be careful to not change any other CS config.h code from your previous working CS installation. This suits both CS Production (main) version v5.4.0+ and versions v5.5.15+ (devel) versions.</p> <p></p> <p>12.3 Edit your myAutomation.h to tell CS to include/create a driver for sensorCAM. Add the sensorCAM driver to your myAutomation.h with a HAL(EXSensorCAM, SENSORCAM_VPIN, 80, 0x11) assuming at I2C address 0x11. The SENSORCAM_VPIN value (typically 700) has been defined in config.h (step 12.2)</p> <p></p> <p>12.4 Now the individual sensor IDs need to be assigned to vPin numbers through the mySetup.h file. They can be added in manually later, so we don't have to have all 80 defined now. (Edit &amp;) copy to the CS folder.</p> <p>Be sure to include a command I2CManager.setClock(100000); if using an older version of DCC-EX as only the latest IO_EXSensorCAM.h drivers v308 and v309 do this automatically.</p> <p></p> <p>12.5 If you are using the DCC-EX installer keep your revised \"myFiles\" in the usual place and include them when requested. Otherwise they go in the same directory (CommandStation-EX) as the CommandStation-EX.ino and related files.</p> <p>With the release of CS Production version v5.4.0, the former sensorCAM myfilter method was made redundant. Versions of CS beyond v5.4.0 all use the CamParser.cpp method and have IO_EXSensorCAM.h CamParser.cpp and CamParser.h included by default. These files DO NOT need to be overwritten. Unless you wish to (were advised to) use the latest \"bleeding edge\" devel versions offered, proceed to step 12.6.</p> <p></p> <p>12.6 Once the changes have been put in place, the CommandStation-EX.ino file will have to be recompiled and loaded into the CS (Mega?) using the Arduino IDE, to invoke the changes. Refer to the sensorCAM manual Appendix G for details on using the CS monitor to replace the sensorCAM USB monitor. Initially it would be helpful to maintain a USB monitor on the sensorCAM to catch and verify activity. Note that there are some differences in the capabilities and format of displays between CAM USB monitor and CS. No visual imagery can be obtained via CS (except webcam) once the USB is disconnected. The CAM MUST be flashing to respond correctly to most \"Native\" CS &lt;N&gt; sensorCAM commands.</p> <p>12.7 After up-loading to the Command Station, open the Arduino Monitor (at 115200 baud) to see the CS \"console\". If the sensorCAM i2c is connected and the CAM running (flashing), the user's &lt;Nw&gt; CS command should issue the CAM wait command (stops flashing) and another &lt;Nw&gt; should resume. Note it can be helpful to have 2 instances of the IDE, so you can separately monitor CS and CAM on two USB ports.</p> <p>The CS installer also has a monitor that can interface to the CS. Try the Processing4 monitor on the CAM.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>With CAM flashing, try &lt;N m&gt;, &lt;N i 11&gt; and &lt;N t 46&gt; to confirm functionality, then &lt;NM&gt; for current min/max settings. Note &lt;N t 0&gt; command returns the LAST value of threshold. Repeat just to confirm changes, if necessary, or just use &lt;NM&gt;. Cmd &lt;Nv&gt; will show the Vpin usage and version of sensorCAM.</p> <p></p> <p>12.8 Powering up the CS and CAM(s) can be problematical. The bootup interactions are affected by the following: a) ALL devices on an i2c bus should be powered for i2c communications to be reliable.</p> <p>b) Full sensorCAM boot-up calls MyWire.begin() which FAILS if a) is incomplete.</p> <p>c) CS bootup executes driver EXSensorCAM::create(); which FAILS if b) is unsuccessful.</p> <p>To avoid a race between b) and c) the CS has a STARTUP_DELAY 5000 (5sec.) to allow b) time to boot. Rebooting a sensorCAM AFTER 5 seconds (b) can break the connection the CS had established, and so it may need to be followed by a reboot of CS (c).</p> <p>Opening an Arduino IDE monitor on the CS OR sensorCAM (or uploading software) can cause a reboot of the respective microprocessor, so the above issue needs to be appreciated and catered for, possibly with a following CS or CAM reboot. It is a common issue with all \"smart\" peripherals (e.g. EX-IOExpander).</p> <p>12.9 To use EX-RAIL, refer to the EX documentation regarding general sensor usage.</p> <p>Refer to the sensorCAM manual Appendix H for further tips regarding sensorCAM with EXRAIL.</p> <p>Note: As there are up to 80 sensors or banks of sensors, the #define CAM .. in step 12.2 above helps. The vPin management can be simplified by using the substitution for vPin of (CAM 0%%) which automatically calculates the vPin for sensor S%%. For example, AT(CAM 010) will wait for S10 to trip.</p> <p>12.10 To manage MULTIPLE sensorCAMs, it is advisable to follow a convention to avoid errors, as follows:</p> <p>a) Choose a sequential address range (e.g. 0x11,0x12,0x13,0x14) for CAM1 CAM2 .. CAM4 respectively, and preferably a simple sequential base_vPin series (e.g. 500,600,700 say). Then using Arduino IDE\u2026</p> <p>b) For each CAM# in turn, open sensorCAM.ino &amp; edit configCAM.h (e.g. #define I2C_DEV_ADDR 0x12 ) AND edit sensorCAM.ino #define BCDver 320 (e.g. change 320 to 12320). THEN File&gt;SaveAs sensorCAM320.12 Upload to CAM# (CAM2). This saves distinct identifiable versions for each one of your multiple CAMs. The 'v' command will identify which CAM is which. (works best for 0x11-17 only)</p> <p>This fudge makes management of multiple sensorCAMs less error prone ('v' will show version as 12.3.20).</p> <p>c) In CS myAutomation.h create sequential drivers for CAM,CAM2, .. (starting with CAM 0x11) (e.g. then</p> <p>HAL(EXSensorCAM, SENSORCAM2_VPIN, 80, 0x12); if needed, repeat for 0x13 &amp; 14.</p> <p>d) In CS config.h, define CAM2, CAM3 &amp; CAM4 as for CAM in config.h (e.g.</p> <p>#define SENSORCAM2_VPIN 600</p> <p>#define CAM2 SENSORCAM2_VPIN+</p> <p>e) edit CS MySetup.h to display all required sensors in each CAM. e.g. for CAM2 (2bs from base vpin 600)</p> <p>for(uint16_t b=1; b&lt;=4;b++) for(uint16_t s=0;s&lt;8;s++) Sensor::create(200+b*10+s,600+b*8+s,1);</p> <p>N.B. This consumes RAM, so unnecessary sensors my cause a MEGA to run out of memory. If memory is limited, only \"create\" (JMRI) sensors that you want to see switching/tripping on the CS monitor.</p> <p>&lt;D RAM&gt; shows remaining free memory. The Command Station cannot run with near 0 free RAM.</p> <p>f) Once loaded and booted, make use of the CamParser switch-cam commands by adding an [optional] cam # to bs numbers (e.g. &lt;N&gt; &lt;Ni 112&gt; &lt;Np 201&gt; &lt;NV 300&gt; &lt;NC vpin&gt;. &lt;N&gt; shows current CAM (vPin).</p> <p>g) In EXRAIL scripts, select CAM# by using ID format (CAM# 0%%) e.g. AT(CAM2 012) for sensor S(2)12.</p> <p>APPENDIX ESP32-CAM pinout reference (CAM version v1.6) &amp; WROVER-CAM</p> <p> </p> <p>N.B. CAM v1.6 has 4x jumpers (cam side) near U0R/U0T pins &amp; CAM v1.9 has 6x jumpers (including RST)</p> <p>In board version v1.9, the \"GND\" pin adjacent GPIO1/U0T is used for RESET (GND/R) to ESP32-CAM and MUST NOT be tied to GND or CAM will remain in RESET mode. CHIP version shows at start of upload, e.g.</p> <p></p> <p>The esp32-CAM-MB obtained with extra headers uses an 8pin CH340N IC unlike the 16 pin package used on the \"regular\" MB devices (micro-B). The wider MB (Type C) also has an issue in that it does NOT have a reset pin because the RST/GND socket is PERMANENTLY connected to GND which may hold CAM v1.9 in permanent Reset.</p> <p>z </p> <p>USB Type C USB Type micro-B V1.6 (NO RST) V1.9 (RST)</p> <p>So - without butchery, one can only use the v1.6 CAM's on this board \u2639, and even then will have to hold the IO0 button in (grounding it) on reset until upload is progressing. As a workaround for v1.9, it may be possible to slice off this MB GND socket completely. View the Camera side of the ESP32-CAM to distinguish the boards.</p> <p>Identification: ESP32-CAM v1.6 has 4x jumpers beside UOR/UOT pins and v1.9 has 6x jumpers (inc. Reset).</p> <p>Using v1.6 with no RTS/DTR reset, users will have to boot up holding IO0 button in to get into programming mode.</p> <p>ESP32-WROVER-DEV or FREENOVE ESP32-WROVER-CAM board with 4Mb PSRAM is an acceptable single board substitute for the ESP32-CAM-MB combo. Both use the ov2640 camera. Version v316 of sensorCAM incorporated minor adjustments to cater for the WROVER pinout differences. The WROVER may be about twice the cost of the ESP32-CAM-MB (without tarrifs), but, if you have one, it is simpler and may be better quality.</p> <p>The WROVER has many more pins than the CAM-MB and may be repurposed without the CAM, BUT with the ov2640 CAM module there is really only one extra pin (GPIO32) free.</p> <p>The FLASH LED is missing, but the on-board blue LED has an output pin GPIO2 instead of GPIO4. SensorCAM v316 flashes the blue LED. There is no fitted external antenna socket.</p> <p>To use sensorCAM (v316 and above) with the WROVER (using i2c pullups on Endpint):</p> <p>1. Add #define CAMERA_MODEL_WROVER_KIT to the end of configCAM.h</p> <p>2. Before compiling, select ESP32 board 'ESP32 Wrover Module' (and 'huge/No OTA' partition) (still using Board Manager installed Espressif 2.0.17, not any newer version)</p> <p>3. Compile &amp; upload sensorCAM.ino (v320) as per ESP32-CAM (using WROVER USB port).</p> <p>4.

Overview","text":"<p>The sensorCAM is a video camera replacement for physical proximity sensors/detectors on a model railroad. It can replace up to 80 detectors and their associated power and signal wiring using artificial vision alone. It offers the flexibility of sensor placement or relocation instantly by software command with no physical layout modification.The railroad can be automated using artificial vision of train activity. Each virtual sensor can produce a logical state of 1(occupied) or 0(unoccupied) and is readable over an i2c cable. SensorCAM uses the ESP32-CAM module.However, the ESP32-WROVER-DEV CAM(v1.6) is an acceptable substitute if appropriate adjustments are made.</p> <p>The sensorCAM takes 10 frames per second in RGB565 format at QVGA resolution of 240 x 320. Each sensor consists of a square group of 16 pixels which equates to approx. 20x20mm square with the standard lens at 1500mm. The software decodes and saves only the 80 sensor images(1280 pixels) and then compares each sensor image with a reference image prerecorded either at startup, on request, or by a\"recent\" automatic update. If the images do not match the references well then the sensor is\"tripped\" or\"occupied\"&amp; status'1' is produced. Good match results in'0' output. The state of virtual sensors can be manually monitored on the USB monitor, or polled by microcontroller over the i2c interface cable. N.B. The sensorCAM is sensing only when the Flash LED is pulsing(for each new frame).</p> <p></p> <p>2PCS ESP32-CAM-MB, Aideepen ESP32-CAM W BT Board ESP32-CAM-MB Micro USB to Serial Port CH-340G with OV2640 2MP Camera Module Dual Mode</p> <p>Visit the Aideepen Store</p> <p>4.1\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605408 ratings| 33 answered questions</p> <p>Amazon's Choice Overall Pick</p> <p>-27%$1899</p> <p></p> <p>Note: While this manual primarily talks about the ESP32-CAM-MB, there is a similar tested alternative in the newer ESP32 WROVER CAM single board option. For some further preliminary details refer to Section 7 Wiring, Figure 6.</p> <p>Dealing with video images involves complexities not normally associated with model railroading sensors. The sensorCAM is a complex device with a number of commands explicitly for setup and evaluation. In addition to these,several\u201coutput\u201d commands can be used by a host to interrogate the\u201cvirtual sensor\u201d output states. The initial setup can be somewhat involved and requires familiarity with most of the 25 commands discussed below.</p> <p>The sensorCAM has two mutually exclusive modes of operation; the sensorCAM mode and the webCAM mode. The webCAM mode is essentially as described in the on-line tutorials. Use that mode only for education and curiosity.Invoke webCAM video mode by issuing the v1(or v2) sensorCAM command to get a webCAM URL(e.g.192.168.0.64)</p> <p>The ESP32-CAM does not have a USB port so you will need an FTDI interface or MB. We prefer the ESP32-CAM-MB(MotherBoard) interface which plugs directly behind the CAM. Check\u201cThe Workshop\u201d You tube videos on-line for guidance. The MB is far simpler to use(needing no jumpers or cables) than a separate FTDI used in the videos.</p> <p>The ESPRESSIF guide will show how to install the Arduino-ESP32 support. BE WARNED: using an FTDI(rather than MB) that has a jumper set to 5V and connecting it to the CAM 3V3 pin will destroy the ESP32-CAM.

The sensorCAM has been programmed with two modes of operation; a webCAM mode(as in the on-line tutorial) and a sensorCAM mode.The limited power of an ESP32 prevents both functioning at the same time. Consequently, to see an image of the railway while sensorCAM is operational requires a third application(Processing 4.2) to retrieve a still image from the CAM over the USB cable to a computer. The Processing 4.pde app replaces the Arduino IDE and IDE monitor retaining the sensorCAM command set and offering a(slow) image capture capability over USB cable. Processing 4 allows virtual sensors to be placed on an image of the railway with a simple mouse click.</p> <p>In addition to the FTDI interface, you will most likely need a daughter board\u201ccarrier\u201d or prototyping board to connect to the real world(power, indicators, control wires, and i2c.) Further details are given below. However to test the sensorCAM functions, one only needs the CAM and a USB module, with power from the USB port.</p> <p>To control a railway, the railway needs a microcontroller based management system. This typically could be an Arduino Mega based system running software such as the DCC-EX CommandStation and EX-RAIL automation application. Alternatively a dedicated sensorCAM microcontroller based interface could be connected to the i2c bus for output on multiple parallel sensor pins as per a more conventional low sensor count sensing device. The EX Command Station(CS) solution requires the addition of sensorCAM specific code(sketches) as detailed later.</p> <p>The lens system on the cam comes in(std)66deg., 120 and 160deg. field of view. One can get longer ribbon versions and even 850nm(IR) versions to experiment with. These versions may be sourced independently of the ESP32-CAM.A wider coverage is possible with a 75-120deg(fish eye) lens, if needing to accommodate a lower ceiling height.</p>"},{"location":"products/ex-sensorcam/02-ex-sensor-manual/#text-2-esp32-cam","title":"$$\\text{ 2.

Follow the above guidelines and run the camera example first, to get a demo webserver and CAM operational with a simple coloured test image. Experiment with settings to\"get a feel\" for the parameter effects which need optimization.

In Stream mode, close observation will reveal changing whole image brightness/colour for several seconds after image disturbance(e.g. a hand in front of CAM) as the auto adjustments\u201ccorrect\u201d the image. These types of changes can trip the sensorCAM even if the obstruction does not block the virtual sensor. Consequently after power-up, the sensorCAM may stabilize and then turn off some auto adjustments in the first 15 seconds. Changing environment lighting may result in a need to use a\u201crecalibrate\u201d command, for example perhaps after sunset or turning on extra lighting.</p> <p>Due to the slowness of the ESP32\\&amp; wifi, the\"live stream\" is slow and a webCAM delay in response will be observed.This may be a little quicker for the sensorCAM sensing mode. The delay is inevitable in webCAM WiFi mode.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 2</p> <p>$$ \\text{Initial sensorCAM settings} $$</p> <p>After the sensorCAM has booted up, it reads frames for 9 seconds before automatically doing a reference grab for all defined sensors(the r00 command). ver320 by default sets the CAM configuration to those below.

The sensorCAM relies on strong colour contrast(saturation) to detect changes. Low lighting levels and poor contrast degrades performance.</p> <p>To run the sensorCAM.ino, it will be necessary to configure the Arduino IDE for the ESP32 as covered in the above you-tube tutorial links. Load and run the demonstration. For the sensorCAM, you will require new files in a directory such as Arduino/sensorCAM as shown below. Create and edit configCAM.h from the example.

It will then take further cycles to assess the state of the 80 virtual sensors in the frame(another two cycles)A total of 5 cycles places a significant limit on the sensorCAM speed of response time(up to 0.5 seconds at 10 frames/second). A fast HO loco can travel 160mm@100kph, so this latency might need to be accommodated in planning virtual sensor locations.</p>"},{"location":"products/ex-sensorcam/02-ex-sensor-manual/#text-3-physical-installation","title":"$$\\text{ 3. Physical Installation}$$","text":"<p>For testing purposes you will need a computer with a spare USB port and the Arduino IDE software installed. The PROCESSING 4 software is also advisable as it gives a more reliable and convenient image for setup. A long powered USB cable(5m?) may be an advantage as the sensorCAM may be some distance from the PC. For a final installation the sensorCAM would be connected via a cat5/6 cable carrying power and a differential i2c bus(of up to 30m) to a microcontroller, Command Station or similar. Some different practical solutions are explored in Appendix F.</p> <p>For a test hookup between a USB powered sensorCAM and a Command Station(mega) with a short existing i2c bus,provided the total length is under say 3 meters, a simple, cheap arrangement could be tried using a PCA9515A buffer and level shifter. It requires soldering 5 wires to the underside of the MB USB interface. This improvisation is not an ideal\u201cuniversal\u201d arrangement. The PCA9515A is mounted on 1/16\u201d thick double-sided adhesive foam mounting tape. The CAM on i2c bus is best used theoretically with the USB computer running on battery power alone(unplugged) to absolutely avoid ground loops and associated electrical noise, but will probably function OK anyway.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3 CAM with 3.3 to 5V i2c interface and optional LTC4311\u201cterminator\u201d for greater reach</p> <p>The sensorCAM is preferably placed above and square-on to a section of layout at a height of 1 to 1.8m above the surface. 1.2m gives a max. coverage of approximately 1.2x0.9m with the standard lens. Another arrangement with several advantages is to place the CAM near the surface so as to view the surface via some good mirror tiles placed on the ceiling, positioned to ensure coverage of the desired sensor locations. This may increase coverage, especially if multiple mirrors are at slight angles. The mirror arrangement with benchtop level mount allows for wider coverage with low ceilings, and also places the CAM in a more accessible spot for wiring and maintenance. Mirror tiles do not need to be perfectly flat, some image distortion is acceptable, but they must be stable. Oblique camera angles may also be used to advantage, but sensor location and tripping point may be compromised somewhat.</p> <p>Lighting is critical for reliable operation. Theoretically, the lighting should be steady. Both LED flood and Fluorescent lighting might degrade results due to the flickering levels of illumination at 100/120 Hz. Use quality LED lights. The light fittings should not be visible in the camera's field of view. A uniform level of lighting is the objective, with a minimum influence from fluctuating daylight, fans and cloud shadows through windows. Some experimentation may be needed to avoid local\u201cglare\u201d. Images may show white test panels to have several drifting horizontal dull bands produced between cycles of the mains supply(Figure 4). Bright lighting is desirable(good quality LEDS?) to enhance colour differentiation. Check for flicker by taking a\u201cslo-mo\u201d video on a cell phone. Fluoro's are bad!</p> <p>The mount needs to be rigid to avoid vibration which can trip sensors due to small image movements. It also needs to have a suitable route for a(cat5) cable for its own power supply and the necessary i2c communications. The length of this cable needs to be considered if the railway's i2c network is otherwise long. The prototype CAM has been fitted with i2c buffers and used on a 20m buffered 5 Volt i2c Cat5 bus, but the quick connection above(using PCA9515A) is for short lengths only(i2c under 3m). Up to 7m may be achieved using 2k pull-up resistance and one LTC4311\u201cterminator\u201d to enhance signal rise time. Benchtop mounting with mirrors minimizes this length issue. A very good alternative for longer cables is the Sparkfun differential Endpoint system.</p> <p>Most reliable results may be obtained with light grey coloured ballast and dark sleepers. If results are inadequate,light green(grass?) or yellow\"reflectors\" between the rails may relieve any problem.(recommended in fiddle yards)If lighting throws shadows beside rolling stock, the shadows can be used advantageously by good sensor placement.</p> <p>For initial configuration, access to the sensorCAM's USB port is important. Loading computer code over a long USB cable is problematic, but monitoring and tweaking settings may be done with a reduced BAUD rate or a(5m?)buffered USB cable at 115200 BAUD. A benchtop mounting with mirror would help here.</p> <p>With regards lighting, fluoroescent or LED lighting normally flickers at twice mains frequency so it pulses at 100 or 120Hz. This is normally tolerable, but it can be seen in a sensorCAM image on a uniformly white test panel as below(Figure 5). In 100mSec there could be up to 10 bands in one image. SensorCAM tries to synchronise with the mains frequency, but if it fails the faint bands will drift across the sensors and potentially trip them in the worst case scenario. Set the threshold high enough to avoid such trips. Figure 4 shows an example of bad 100Hz banding.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 4 Test image showing fluorescent or LED light banding.</p>"},{"location":"products/ex-sensorcam/02-ex-sensor-manual/#4-notation-help-commands","title":"4.

Each bank can be tested as a whole to see if ANY sensors tripped or NO sensors tripped. Also placing a string of sensors in a row, for example along a platform, can indicate train position with the binary bank value increasing as the train approaches a signal as it crosses sensors 0 through 7.(see Figure 5 for examples) Sensors are generally referred to with a two digit bank/sensor designation(their bsNo.)e.g Sensor 68 and 69 are therefore invalid bs numbers, 97 is valid. Use one bank for a platform(set of 8 sensors).Sensor S00 is reserved as a brightness reference sensor. Sensor S06 is also RESERVED for now. It is suggested that user's Sensors start with bank 1, i.e. S10(vPin..8), S11 upwards, with related sensors in their own bank. They do not need to be sequential(Follow the installation Guide for full details). With the recommended definitions set up,the use does not need to remember or refer to vPins for sensorCAM sensors.</p> <p>For an EX-Command Station(CS), the 80 sensors will have vPin numbers ranging from#00 to#79(DECIMAL) and mapped to 80 b/s id's(S00 to S97).

If you want to set a different range to use this feature, change configCAM.h from the default(030) before upload.</p> <p>5.4 Follow you-tube to pre-configure the Arduino IDE for ESP32. IF using an FTDI interface take EXTREME care not to connect 5V to the 3.3V CAM supply pin as this destroys CAMs. Using this IDE, load the software into sensorCAM with it unmounted. Then mount the CAM in a suitable place for tests. A long USB cable is problematical.</p> <p>5.5 Establish a USB connected monitor(e.g. Arduino IDE monitor, or PROCESSING4 monitor, preferably at 115200 baud. The PROCESSING 4 monitor coded for the sensorCAM has the advantage of displaying the CAM's railroad image(or selected part thereof), all-be-it rather slowly!). Because of the many changeable CAM parameters, the WiFi link(webCAM) is not a reliable indicator of the sensorCAM image quality. It may be better or worse. The PC(using Arduino IDE) is only able to show images via WiFi, but because the sensorCAM runs on RGB565 format it cannot send WiFi(jpeg) images without rebooting into WiFi/jpg webCAM mode(under which it cannot read sensors!). The reboot/display/reboot cycle for WiFi webCAM is also tediously time consuming.</p> <p>The sensorCAM takes some time to boot and establish sensing mode. The white flash LED starts flashing on every frame after about 10 seconds and data flows to the USB terminal. A period of averaging ensues with\u201cgood\u201d sensing by about 30 seconds. This flow of data(and sensing!) can be suspended with the\u2018w\u2019 wait command. Some commands(including a blank line entry) will subsequently restart the sensing camera and sensor output. The CAM may crash if it is left waiting for input for over 30 minutes. Reference images would also be long out of date.</p> <p>5.6 The CAM can be switched to WiFi video mode with the'v1' command.'v2' will select an alternate WiFi network.('v' will give sensorCAM software version).'v1'(or'v2') will reboot and load WiFi mode connecting to the network selected, and providing a URL e.g. http://192.168.0.xx that can be used to connect with a browser. An image, like Figure 1 above, should be seen with controls for experimenting with Brightness etc. This image is educational but not necessarily a good indication of the sensorCAM(sensor mode) image because of the unpredictable parameter effects. To see a more reliable image run the PROCESSING 4 SensorCAM.pde monitor instead of Arduino IDE monitor(refer Section 6.).

The setup commands will have to be repeated accurately once the CAM is mounted in its final location.</p> <p>5.8 Setting up the CAM first requires locating sensors. When deciding on sensor location, be aware that the sensor response is slow compared to conventional sensors. Allowing for 500mSec delay, which at 100kph equates to 150mm of travel(in HO), may influence sensor placement. Best performance is obtained if the sensors are not within 20 rows/columns of an image edge. Remember to save to EPROM with the\u2018e\u2019 command once satisfied.Virtual sensor location can be set up in several ways. Option D is preferred.</p> <p>A. Automatic loading from EPROM on bootup. This is only applicable after an initial sensor set has been established and command'e' used to save them to EPROM.</p> <p>B. The bright LED method: Place a bright LED at the required location and reduce room lighting if needed.Issue an's%%' command(e.g.s00 for an off-track reference sensor) and wait for the CAM to scan and locate the LED and setup sensor coordinates. Remove the LED, restore lighting, and perform an\u2018r%%\u2019 for new reference images.</p> <p>C. Issue a\u2018k%%,rrr,xxx\u2019 command to place sensor%% at CAM pixel position xxx(column) and row rrr(y). This method is most useful for\"tweaking\" coordinates if you want to adjust the result of the LED method(the CAM has 240 rows/lines of 320 pixels each, numbered from 0). Use the\u2018i%%\u2019 command for status of sensor.NOTE: Use\u2018k' to set up test sensors initially, but delay setting final positions until Processing 4 installed and enhanced\u2018k\u2019 and\u2018a\u2019 available. The alternate advanced\u2018a\u2019 command does 3 commands in one(i.e. k, a,&amp; r).</p> <p>D. Running Processing 4, an image can be downloaded, a bsNo. nominated by typing k%%(or a%%) and the mouse click on the image appends coordinates to k%%. Press Enter if the command is complete and correct.Similarly, the enhanced version of'a%%' sets position, enables, and records a reference all in one command.</p> <p>5.9 Once a sensor has been located, the'p$' command can show/tabulate all defined positions up to bank$. To enable a sensor use the\u2018a%%\u2019 command. This will enable AND record a new reference image for the sensor. It will then be included in the screen\u201cdata dump\u201d. Only\u201cenable\u201d sensors when UNoccupied, or do an\u2018r%%\u2019 later when the sensor is empty. Also, remember to do an\u2018e\u2019 command when you want to save positions in EPROM for next time.</p> <p>5.10 A threshold needs to be set to define the level of difference in image required to register a sensor trip or\u201cOccupation\u201d. This typically ranges from 40 to 60. Try\u2018t45\u2019 for starters. Some fluctuating lighting and electrical\u201cnoise\u201d needs to be tolerated, but a higher threshold reduces sensor sensitivity for dark-on-dark contrast in particular. If there are\u201cnoise\u201d trips, adjust the threshold or min2trip a little higher. See APPENDIX B for more.</p> <p>5.11 It is desirable to set a maxSensors parameter(e.g. 030) to limit diagnostic printouts to a useful screen width,and especially important to set the min2flip parameter which helps filter out noise trips. However min2flip slows the response to valid trips by 100mSec per extra count(frame rate). Suggest settings of 2(default) or 3. e.g.'m3,40' say.Note: maxSensors(pulled from EPROM) limits the following....</p> <p>1 the data stream for console/monitor, limited to enabled sensors below maxSensors(and above minSensors)</p> <p>2 histogram printout, to enabled sensors below maxSensors(see statistics command\u2018&amp;\u2019)</p> <p>3 the boxlt() sensor boxes seen on Processing 4 images, for enabled sensors below maxSensors</p> <p>4 i2c buffer data for't' record, to bsn's below maxSensors(and above minSensors)(sent to Command Station)The cmd't' acts as a flag to prepare a packet of i2c data that the CS can reconstitute as per the USB ASCII data stream.</p> <p>5.12 If you want a LED bank occupancy indicator on the CAM, use the'n$' command to cause a bank occupied LED to show(default Bank 2). nLED, min2flip, maxSensors and threshold can be saved to EPROM, along with sensor positions and twins(see 15. below) with the'e' command. minSensors is not currently saved in EPROM(set by'n')</p> <p>5.13 Although sensor enabling(a) causes an immediate reference capture, it may be necessary to occasionally do a fresh reference capture for all sensors(make sure they are unoccupied!) by using the'r00' command. Individual sensor references can be refreshed using\u2018r%%\u2019. The results of a refresh can be seen in the scrolling\u201cdata dumps\u201dwhich show enabled sensors, their\u201cdifference scores\u201d(32-99), and their perceived occupancy state. The sensor 00 is constantly averaged and refreshed every 6.4 seconds. Furthermore, there is an automatic refresh process that cycles through enabled sensors and regularly averages 32 consecutive sample images. If the sensor remains unoccupied, it updates the reference, compensating for slow lighting changes. This is SUSpended initially(after Reset) until an'r%%' command is issued by the user, after which\"SUS\" will disappear from the output data. The latest version of sensorCAM ASSUMES the sensors are all empty, and automatically ends SUSpend mode early.</p> <p>5.14 The scrolling data dump displays\u201cSUS\u201d if auto updates are off. It also displays threshold(T), min2trip(M),the bank assigned to the on-board LED(N), S00 reference diff. score, as well as the S00 reference brightness(R) and its current actual brightness(A) and other enabled sensors.\u2018A\u2019 is the Actual latest sum of the 48 bytes of a sensor image and should be between 1200 and 2500 ideally. Following a reference refresh(r), for an unoccupied image,the\u201cnoisy\u201d diff scores should be 32-37. If references are being updated, a note will appear at the right hand side of the data dump in the form of\u201cRef 0%%\u201d to indicate that a new reference for an UNOCCUPIED sensor has occurred.This dump allows for performance monitoring during commissioning. Tripped(occupied) sensors are shown by default with an\u201coo\u201d&amp;\u201c##\u201d but using the\u2018@##\u2019 command the character can be changed to any ASCII character(01-127). An output like:?-46-?* indicates an above threshold image potentially occupied, whereas:oo47?T* indicates suspected occupied but no confirmation from Twin(see 5.15). For recent versions of Arduino IDE monitor,\u2018@\u2019 or\u2018@12\u2019 command gives a particularly wide BOLD\u201cspade\u201d\u201coccupied\u201d character that is easy to spot(don't use@ or@12 if it doesn't produce the\u201cspade\u201d as it will misalign columns. Try@11 instead.).</p> <p>5.15 If necessary, another option can be tried to address\"noise\" trips if all else fails. It is possible to\"get a second opinion\" on a sensor by assigning a\"Twin\" sensor(using i%%,$$). For example if sensor S15 is prone to noise trips, set a Twin using sensor S05(say). Set up the Twin position to touch or slightly overlap the primary sensor(S15)with the commands\u2018a05,rrr,xxx\u2019. The primary sensor will not register\u201cOccupied\u201d(trip) unless the Twin agrees. The Twin should have a bsNo less than the primary sensor to avoid introducing an extra 100mSec delay to the trip time as the lowest bsNo is evaluated first. We suggest using bank 0 for twins, or a lower number in the same bank.</p> <p>5.16 There are other commands that can be used to optimise the CAM performance by trial-and-error. These include Calibrate(c),Frame(f),GetCAMsettings(g),adJustCAMsettings(j),and Statistics(&amp;).If the scene contrast is inadequate, a lighter reflector between the tracks is a cure particularly in fiddle yards(e.g. light green grass).</p> <p>Explore and familiarize: Operational output commands will give the sensor states and include Individual(i), Bank(b),Diff(d), Position(p),&amp; Query enabled(q). Other input sensor commands include Zero(o), One(l), Enable(a),Undefine(u)&amp; the define coordinate(k) command. Zero'o'(oscar) and One'l'(lima) preset and disable sensors.</p> <p>NOTE: The term\u201cactivate\u201d has been used in the CAM program rather than\u201cenable\u201d. In the context of sensorCAM,activated means\u201cenabled\u201d rather than output\u201c1\u201d as typically used in EX-CS documentation. This manual has been rewritten to use the\"enabled\" terminology, but names and references in the actual program still use the original terminology, so interpret\u201cactivated\u201d, in a sensorCAM context, as\u201cenabled\u201d. Sensor output is referred to as\"tripped\"(1/occupied) or\"untripped\"(0/unoccupied).</p> <p>Test image with Fluorescent or LED lighting- note three faint dull stripes across white test panel in Figure 5 below.Strong banding is also evident in Figure 4. Horizontal stripe position varies frame-to-frame as not effectively synchronized with mains yet.(Figure 5 image was obtained using V, H&amp; Y60 Processing4 commands)</p> <p>The mains supply synchronization is currently inadequate(CAM limitation) so drifting illumination bands will add a little to the\"noise\" seen by the sensors. The significance of this may need evaluation by experiment.</p> <p>5.17 Two additional features have been added which may resolve lingering issues. Individual thresholds can be set to override the\"global\" threshold set with't##'. The command't##,\\%\\%' will set a pvtThreshold for sensor  $S\\%\\%$ replacing the\u201cglobal\u201d(t##) value. It can be removed with the't00,%%' command. This way a higher threshold can be set on a\u201cnoisy\u201d sensor. While an increased pvtThreshold may reduce its sensitivity, it has no effect on the other sensors.\u2018t1,%%\u2019 will cancel all pvtThresholds in one bank%, while\u2018t1,99\u2019 cancels ALL pvtThresholds in the CAM.</p> <p>The second feature enables the size of the sensor to be increased. This is done by inserting spare pixels in a cross(+)through the 4x4 sensor moving 4 pixels out to each of the corners of a larger footprint. The parameter SEN_SIZE(default 0) adds from 1 to 9 rows of spare pixels. This parameter is set in configCAM.h and may, for example allow a sensor to be placed so as to register a greater variation in pixel values. A uniform 16 identical pixels is less effective than ones capturing various colours/shades. If it can include a shadow of a passing loco/wagon, then the\u201cdiff\u201d can be stronger and a more positive trip attained. A footprint size increase affects ALL sensors.</p> <p>It is desirable to place sensors where they generate a\u201cmottled\u201d image of pixels rather than a uniform colour which makes distinguishing grey roofs against plain grey track hard. Pixel size is therefore relevant. It is helpful if the pixels are the width of sleepers so they can be distinguished. If they can't then try an offset sensor that sees track bed and trackside grass/shadows say. Table 1 indicates pixel/sensor sizes relative to sleepers and track gauge. It shows that sleeper detection is limited with the ov2640 QVGA(240x320) resolution. Future sensorCAM variants may do better.An angled camera could benefit from a glimpse of the side of the loco/coach/wagon.</p> OV2640 CAM(std lens) OV2640 CAM(std lens) OV2640 CAM(std lens) 50 deg view CAMERA DISTANCE: CAMERA DISTANCE: (mm) 800 800 1000 1000 1200 1200 1500 1500 1800 1800 pixel size QVGA (mm) 2.18 2.18 2.73 2.73 3.27 3.27 4.09 4.09 4.91 4.91 SEN_SIZE: 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 Sensor Size Sensor Size (pixels) 4x4 $6\\times 6$ 4x4 6x6 4x4 $6\\times 6$ 4x4 $6\\times 6$ 4x4 $6\\times 6$ ratio:gauge/sensor ratio:gauge/sensor scale sleeper std gauge 1:43. 5 32 3.7 2.4 2.9 2.0 2.4 1.6 2.0 1.3 1.6 1.1 HO 1:87 2.5 16.5 1.9 1.3 1.5 1.0 1.3 0.8 1.0 0.7 0.8 0.6 TT 1:120 1.8 12 1.4 0.9 1.1 0.7 0.9 0.6 0.7 0.5 0.6 0.4 N 1:160 1.3 9 1.0 0.7 0.8 0.6 0.7 0.5 0.6 0.4 0.5 0.3 (mm) (mm) <p>Table 1.

As previously stated, the PROCESSING4 application is a crude USB monitor that enables the user to control and configure the sensorCAM with the additional benefit of being able to invoke a display of the image. All the sensorCAM commands can be used. At 115200 baud, a full RGB565 image takes 13 seconds, but it is often convenient to reduce this by prescribing a smaller image segment of limited rows and/or columns(e.g.Y120 for half of a 240 row screen). The Processing 4 application can be downloaded from this URL:https://processing.org</p> <p>The SensorCAM.pde code assumes the USB port for the sensorCAM is the lowest(comNo=0;) on the list displayed on startup. Should this not be the case, for example if another USB is being used to simultaneously run an IDE to a Command Station, then the comNo=0; code line of the.pde will need to be increased to, for example, int comNo=1;You may also increase the image display window size by editing the final int SF=2; line to=3 or 4 on high res screens.</p> <p>Both Processing 4.2 and 4.3 have been tested successfully.</p> <p>The sensorCAM Processing 4 monitor accepts commands W, X, Y&amp; Z which allow one to nominate a\u201cstrip\u201d or subsection to image. e.g. Z80 X240 Y will update the last quarter image(columns 240-319) of the 240x320 pixels in 4 seconds. This method enables, for example, comparison of quarter images under different lighting conditions by using different X values.. Similarly W60_ Y120_ will produce a quarter image from row 120. Each part image is pasted over previous images. Each new image appears more quickly if only a subsection is specified this way. The next image can be flipped Vertically(y) and Horizontally(x) by using V&amp;/or H before capture. The Figure 5 image used  $V_{H} Y 60_{H}$  The values for V, H, W, X\\&amp; Z are remembered for subsequent'Yrrr' commands so need not be repeated.

The Sparkfun Endpoints are used in pairs and can cater for voltage shifting between 5V Command Stations(e.g. Mega)and 3.3V sensorCAM as required. For the very simplest off-the-shelf arrangement, an ESP32-WROVER-DEV CAM with a cheap ESP32 breakout board including regulator can be linked to an Endpoint with 4 Dupont wires for a working CAM system on the end of a cat5 cable of considerable length as indicated in Figure 6, needing only a remote, preferably electrically isolated(floating),9-12Vdc 0.5A power supply and a matching endpoint on a Command Station. Note: The Sparkfun Endpoint may also need a jumper cut or joined for i2c bus voltage level matching to the Command Station.</p> <p>The SensorCAM software has been almost exclusively tested on the ESP32-CAM-MB as seen in Figure 7. The original prototype was fitted with some enhancements that may not be needed for the users application, such as an external antenna and extra LED indicators. NOTE that an Antenna attachment to the ESP32-CAM requires a solder link adjustment on the CAM(refer you-tube CAM tutorials) but most wi-fi works with the on-board antenna.

See Appendix F for a more capable Sparkfun Endpoint configuration using a separate 5V switching regulator, at a small increase in cost and effort.</p> <p>The ESP32-CAM reset button, remotely mounted, may be difficult to access.

It might be a Command Station running DCC-EX and EXRAIL software, or your own personal device&amp; code. If the sensorCAM is powered up with default settings(from EPROM), or adjusted by the user at the start, the program need only talk to sensorCAM over an i2c bus using the commands a,b,i,I&amp; o for example, or it may be more sophisticated, providing a channel from a Control Station console to the sensorCAM to enable all configuration commands via the i2c bus.</p> <p>The i2c bus is running at 100kHz on the prototype software. It has not been tested at any higher speed yet. It is running fine over a 20m long i2c bus to the master microcontroller(mpu or Mega).</p> <p>8.2 DCC-EX CS: Setting up a DCC-EX Command Station, should you have one, requires configuration details placed in files config.h and mySetup.h along with a driver IO_EXSensorCAM.h and myAutomation.h. These must go in the directory containing file CommandStation-EX.ino. The IO_EXSensorCAM.h driver is based on the modified IO_EXIOExpander.h code. Refer to APPENDIX H for installation details. EXSensorCAM.h code mirrors the i,I,o,t&amp; m commands, while the EXIODPUP command may serve as the enable function(a). EXIOExpander.h codes don't have the\u201ccontrol&amp; setup\u201d sensorCAM functions otherwise available from a USB console so additional functionality was added using the DCC-EX sensorCAM native command(if using the newest CamParser.cpp). <p>8.3 Proprietary Master: If writing raw code for a Control Station, you will need details on the protocol used by sensorCAM on the i2c bus, and code to interpret the bus bytes and reconstitute text for the console. Two such prototype examples exists. V155 of sensorCAM incorporates a subset of the DCC-EX IOexpander codes so that EXRAIL can use sensorCAM without further modification. V301&amp; later mostly use ASCII code characters.</p> <p>8.4 Gross Lighting changes will have two effects, namely cause trips of most sensors and stop automatic reference refreshes, it may be wise to include monitoring for this eventuality by detecting and setting an\u201calarm\u201d state. The reference sensor(S00) is automatically re-referenced every 6.4 seconds so will indicate a fault-trip for a maximum of 6.4 seconds. All other sensors will continue to indicate a trip until the user resets the references with an r00(having checked all unoccupied). Setting up a second\"reference\" sensor(say S01) that would NOT get reset automatically and would stay tripped as a more enduring fault indicator could be helpful. You could reserve entire bank 0 for this purpose or use the'nO' command to set the programmable pLED to light up if there is any enduring trip on bank 0.By default BLKOLED was set to GPIO2 LED, with BLK1LED to BLK3LED all set to GPIO33 LED. PLED is set to GPIO14.1 December 202514</p>"},{"location":"products/ex-sensorcam/02-ex-sensor-manual/#9-methodology-of-operation","title":"9. Methodology of operation","text":"<p>9.1 Overview: The sensorCAM monitors up to 80 small square images(virtual sensors) each consisting of 16 pixels(4x4) the coordinates of which relate to the row/column of the top left pixel. The top left pixel of the QVGA(240x320) image is an r,c coordinate of 0,0. Sensors with coordinate 0,0 are considered\"undefined\". Sensors are electrically'noisy', so much effort was applied to avoid noise trips.</p> <p>After boot-up, every virtual sensor is imaged and a Sensor_ref[] recorded. This is a ONE frame grab as a first guess.All sensors should preferably be UNoccupied at boot up. If not, the user will have to manually take reference grabs at an appropriate time using the'r%%' commands. The'r%%' also triggers an IMMEDIATE start of a 3.2sec average Ref for S%%.'r00' triggers a 1 frame reference refresh for ALL sensors but also starts the auto reference process, as does r%%. The latest version, at boot-up, commences regular averaged reference updates assuming all unoccupied.If an occupied state occurs during the averaging, the averaged ref. is rejected.</p> <p>Every 100mSec the sensor pixels are decoded from the RGB565 QVGA image(2 byte) into RGB666 3 byte format and compared with the reference sensor image(in Sensor_ref[]) for changes. To allow for drifting light intensity,Sensor_ref[] needs to be periodically updated. The automatic updates occur for each enabled sensor(0/1 through 9/7 sequentially, each using a 32 sample average(in~3.5seconds) and replacing the old Sensor_ref[] provided there were no\"trips\" of the sensor during the sample period(3.5sec.). Hence updates occur only when sensor is UNoccupied, and only once every N*3.5sec.(N being the number of enabled sensors). The brightness sensor(S00) is updated independently every 6.4 seconds with a 64 sample average. Each update is flagged to the monitor as it occurs(as\"Ref  $0\\%\\%\"$  ). It is inadvisable to leave a sensor occupied for long periods if best reliability is desired. If a sensor is occupied for long periods of drifting illumination, the ref can become out-of-date to an extent that the sensor can remain PERMANENTLY\"occupied\". Manual re-referencing(r%%) would become necessary.</p> <p>To detect a\"trip\" of a sensor, an algorithm evaluates a\"difference\" score between Sensor666[] and Sensor_ref[].The(bpd) score is a brightness plus colour-diff sum. This(bpd) score is compared with the threshold('t%%') value. If it exceeds the threshold, a flag is set and if after\"min2trip\" frames it remains set, then the Sensor\"trips\". It will then fall back(untrip) if min2trip frames go below threshold. min2trip is set to 2 by default as 3 will give an extra+100mS delayed response. The monitor data stream(scroll) includes the bsNo%%, potential for trip\"?-\", the\"bpd\"score, or actual trip\"oo\" and\"##\". If a twin(see below) inhibits trip, it indicates this with\"?T\". Minimum bpd is 32(identical). e.g.(with t45) 12:--38--* 13:?-46-?* 14:oo50##* 15:?-53?T* 16:--35--* Only S14 has tripped.</p> <p>A\u201csecond opinion\u201d may be used to maintain a quick\"trip\" with greater reliability. This involves setting up a second\"twin\" sensor adjacent to the primary sensor. The primary sensor will only trip if the secondary sensor agrees.(e.g.example for S15 above). The'i%%,$$' command nominates a twin sensor(S$$) for sensor S%%. The(non-00) twin should have a lower bsNo than the primary to avoid extra delay, as they are evaluated in ascending bsNo order.</p> <p>As the sensor image suffers from excessive noise at low light levels, another averaging process has been included.For bsNo.s below 3/0(parameter TWOIMAGE_MAXBS), two consecutive images are averaged to remove noise spikes.The effect can be observed if one watches two sensors with the same coordinates but above and below 3/0, and with a suitably low temporary threshold.

These ratios are compared to that of the reference image for changes. The process in more detail is as follows:</p> <p>Each sensor is split into 4 quadrants(quad), each quad has 4 pixels of 3 colours(48 x 6-bit bytes in total)</p> <p>The sum of all 12 bytes(43) in a quad is found as a quad brightness(4off) and the sum(4) of each colour(rgb) for each quad is found giving a total of 12 colour sums(3 colours 4 quads) plus 4 brightness values</p> <p>Within each quad,3 colour ratios are calculated for Red/green green/blue blue/red(largest(*32) divided by smallest(any 0 changed to 1) to give 12 colour ratios, each&gt;=32(32 if identical)(placed in array Cratio[12])</p> <p>Compare the values in Cratio[12] with the reference array(precomputed from Sensor_ref[]) and find the maximum\u201cXratio\u201d between the two sets of 12\u201cCratios\u201d using the same formula(giving Xratios of 32 to 2016)</p> <p>Set maxDiff to the largest ratio for a sensor from the 12\u201cXratios\u201d</p> <p>A brightness score is similarly calculated between the full ref. brightness and that for the current sensor using formula 16*bright/Sen_Brightness_Ref[bsn]-16. It is scaled to give a value from 0 upwards. With brightSF=2, a score of 2 represents about 7% brighter so is relatively insensitive. Code uses int so,&lt;=6% difference gives a 0 score.</p> <p>The\u201cdiff\u201d score(bpd) comprises of(bright*brightSF+maxDiff)(&gt;=32) and is weighted towards colour difference+small brightness component(of 2 for 7% change)</p> <p>The diff(bpd) is compared to threshold for a decision on trip state. If greater than threshold, several additional checks are made including requiring 2 consecutive frames to exceed threshold, averaging pixels over two frames,and possibly confirmation from a twin sensor. These contribute to an additional response time delay(+100mSec).Furthermore the reference image is normally based on a 32 frame average pixel to eliminate any\u201cnoise\u201d in the sensor reference itself.</p> <p>9.3 Program Summary: Once the sensorCAM parameters and environmental conditions are set, the sensorCAM will run continuously, looping once per 100mSec.

These sensors can detect the presence of any wagon/coach/loco obstructing any part of a(potentially curved) siding. Unlike conventional electrical occupancy detectors, it requires no extensive axle replacement on all rolling stock or complex IR or other style detectors and wiring.</p> <p>The\u201clinear\u201d detector consists of a series of spot sensors utilizing multiple sensors in one bank and normally ending with the last sensor in the bank(i.e. S%7). The four spots of one S%% are spaced at an even multiple of pixels from 0 to 15 sloping to right or left. Spacing of deltaX and deltaR are specified as integers from 0 to 63 giving a theoretical maximum length of 63 x 1.41 x 8 pixels(710pixels). The sensorCAM resolution is 240x320 only, so shorter spacing is normal and gives a better result. One may also use up fewer std. Sensors(max 8/bank) to cover the required distance.</p> <p></p> <p>After creating a line, a refresh(Y) of the Processing4 image should show a series of standard sensors placed on every fourth spot(e.g. S34-S37). Interpolate between top left sensor quadrants for visual line alignment. v312+ shows the(orange) spots between Sensors.</p> <p>To create a\"curved\" intrusion curtain line, one can start at the top with a straight line and then change the slope()) on each successive S%% checking the image after each adjustment. Alternatively place up to 8 std. consecutive sensors and then convert each in turn to a joining line using\\%% repeatedly.</p> <p>While individual sensor segments can be read by the Command Station in the usual way, a line sensor should be read/tested as a bank. The sensorCAM(b) command shows a byte value dependent on all sensors in the bank in bits 7-0. The\u201cvalue\u201d of a bank will rise if sensors set the bits such that, for the example above, the value will exceed 16(2^4) if any sensor in the range S34-S37 is tripped. The EX-RAIL commands, such as IFGTE(CAM 034, 16), will respond to the tripping of the line sensor.</p> <p>The line sensors may require an individual pvtThreshold rather than Threshold as their sensitivity will differ. The line sensor can have a pvtThreshold PROVIDED it is only stored in the last sensor(e.g. S37).

Endpoints)","text":"<p>Note: This Appendix focuses on the ESP32-CAM-MB implementation, but as an alternative, consider the newer ESP32 WROVER-CAM and breakout board, as mentioned in Section 7, Figure 6 for a simpler implementation.</p> <p>The CAM drives GPIO pins with 3.3V logic. This may well be incompatible with the master l2C signals at 5V. It is essential that appropriate voltage level shifting and buffering is used where necessary. Unbuffered I2C is limited in range but a cheap P82B715 bus extender gives up to 30m of I2C capability. A Sparkfun differential i2c driver/endpoint may be used to achieve long lengths and voltage shifting(3.5v to 5v). The prototype Sensor CAM was mounted on a\u201cperf\u201d board that holds two bank trip LEDs, power LED, I2C buffer, a number of required pull-up resistors, capacitors and a voltage regulator so that it can operate and be powered over a single 5m CAT5 cable for greater convenience. A 3m USB connection need only be used for setup and diagnosis. The prototype board plugs into the socket of ESP32-CAM-MB USB adaptor(with 5V pin cut off) but can also use other FTDI interfaces.</p> <p>The CAM prototype can be Reset remotely by software or by cycling the power supply. It can be placed in program mode by a logic signal(GPIO0) over the CAT5 cable if needed, and similarly placed in WebServer mode(GPIO14) or Sensor mode remotely independent of I2C master. The GPIO0&amp; 14 pins may be isolated from CAT5 cable with MOSFETS. The CAM MUST be rigidly mounted as it's response to any image vibration can trip sensors.It is best not moved after sensor location programming as precise realignment could be tedious. It is, however,advisable to make guides or jig arrangement to at least be able to remove(for maintenance) and return with minimal misalignment to cover the same field of view. The LED method of placing/positioning sensors may be necessary if a long USB cable is impractical. A 5m buffered USB cable might be advantageous. Even so,programming or imaging over a long USB cable may never be satisfactory.</p> <p>One PCA9515A based module offers a simpler, but limited, interface to an i2c bus the use of will act as a level changer(3.3V to 5V) and can connect to a SHORT i2c bus(max 3m). You may use 2mm foam adhesive tape to mount a PCA9515A on the back of an ESP32-CAM-MB and solder on the 5 jumper wires directly as shown below.If the i2c length is near or just over the limit, an optional LTC4311 extender can be attached to boost the signal.This option relies on 5V USB power so needs a dedicated(permanent) USB cable connection.</p> <p>A programmable nLED&amp; 330ohm resistor may be attached to the PCA9515A from 3.3V VCC to GPIO14.</p> <p></p> <p>Alternatively, The Sparkfun endpoint is perhaps the best overall solution at this stage for driving one(or more) sensorCAMs. It provides greater lengths of cable without extending the Command Station i2c local bus. The endpoints are used in pairs, connected by a long(&lt;100m) differential pair cat5 cable providing power and communications. It can provide buffering, level shifting and power, but care is needed at the CS end to avoid over-voltage damage. It is suggested, with a 5V CS, that the Endpoint pullup jumpers at the CS end be cut for safety. The sensorCAM Endpoint default pullups are needed for the 3.3V CAM i2c bus.The CS Endpoint requires 3.3V power(from the CS) and a separate(7 to 9V) DC supply for the Buck\\&amp; CAM.</p> <p>Typical device applications(with BUCK 5V inverters):</p> <p></p> <p>$$ \\text{Sparkfun endpoints(requires a matching sparkfun endpoint at CS)(CS interface option B):} $$</p> <p></p> <p>(Dual optional) CAM wiring with Endpoints\\&amp; 5V Buck reg. powered over GRN-GRNW(Vin) with Vin(&gt;7V)</p> <p></p> <p>With Dual CAM header:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>NOTE: Take care to cut copper strips appropriately!</p> <p></p> <p>There are three basic variations below for connecting the Endpoints to the CS. The choice depends on the current system being extended. Options A\\&amp; B apply to a 5Volt I2C bus on a 5V CS with or without existing I2C accessory connections, while Option C is the simplest connection to a 3.3Volt CS i2c bus.</p> <p>The  $2 x$  Endpoints require about  $10 m A$  each. All options can be adapted for use with a mux if necessary.The choice between A and B depends on the power supplies available. If the CS Endpoint is to be tapped into a\"remote\" 5V i2c bus location, a CS 3.3V supply may not be available, only a 5V I2C supply. Option B removes one 10k pullup resistor pair from the bus to avoid inappropriate pull-up voltage(3.3V).</p> <p>Option A: CUT CAM endpoint jumper 0-1 and supply 5V and 3.3V from the CS. Option A connections results in a 5V i2c interface to 3.3V differential cable for 5V microprocessor based CS(e.g. Mega).</p> <p>Option B: may be used if the CS 3V3 regulator is more convenient. CUT two CS Endpoint I2C jumpers to disconnect the on-board I2C pullup 10k resistors and 3v3 from the bus. This adds load to the i2c bus data so may need extra pullups to 5V. This does function but is not recommended.</p> <p>Option C: used with newer(32bit) MPU's&amp; uses 3V3 throughout. No Endpoint jumpers need to be cut.Whichever option is used, the user should consider if the I2C bus needs to be tuned differently. For very short extra cable length to the Endpoint and only one extra device count on an I2C bus under 1m in length, tuning may be unnecessary. In marginal conditions consider returning as per DCC-EX recommendations.</p> <p>A FOR 3.3V Differential drive 5V CS I2C BUS</p> <p></p> <p>B FOR 3.3V Differential drive 5V CS I2C BUS</p> <p></p> <p>C FOR 3.3V Differential drive 3.3V CS I2C BUS</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"products/ex-sensorcam/02-ex-sensor-manual/#appendix-g","title":"APPENDIX G","text":""},{"location":"products/ex-sensorcam/02-ex-sensor-manual/#i2c-sensorcam-commands-protocol","title":"I2C sensorCAM commands&amp; PROTOCOL.","text":"<p>With version 3.00 of IO_EXSensorCAM.h CS driver, commands and parameters are sent to the CAM as a short string of binary bytes to be interpreted by sensorCAM.

Then commands for CAM pin 5 become: e.g. AT(CAM+5) or AT(ESSEX+05)</p> <p>e.g.#define SENSORCAM_VPIN 700//place in config.h or myAutomation.h or mysetup.h#define CAM SENSORCAM_VPIN+//in config.h or myAutomation.h or mysetup.h</p> <p>Valid EXRAIL commands: AFTER(CAM 5)AT(SENSORCAM_VPIN+7)IFGTE(CAM 010, 2)</p> <p>To avoid frequent\u201cCAM\u201d in scripts, an alias can be assigned e.g. ALIAS(ESSEX_P1, CAM+0x10)</p> <p>With each sensorCAM having up to 80 sensors, it is desirable to test groups of(1 to 8) sensors with a single EXRAIL test using the IFGTE() or IFLE() commands. To do this, the sensors are logically arranged in\u201cbanks\u201d of(consecutive) vpins. The logical grouping available can be written in the form\u201cbs\u201d or b/s where b can have bank values of 0-9(10 banks) and s values 0-7(8 sensors). IFGTE and IFLT read a whole bank\u201cvalue\u201d. Native CAM commands can also be issued e.g. PARSE(\u201c\u201d) for bank 4. <p>EXRAIL can accept\u201cb/s\u201d numbering(e.g. 47) if we add a leading 0. e.g. vpin= SENSORCAM_VPIN+ 047 e.g. IFGTE(CAM 047,1) provided values are defined for SENSORCAM_VPIN\\&amp; CAM(as above).</p> <p>(N.B.\u201cCAM\u201d includes the\u2018+\u2019) Using this method there is no need to remember assigned vPin values!</p> <p>Example 1: For the approach to a signal, several sensors may be deployed(say S13 to S17) with S17 last at the signal. As a train approaches the signal, the(bank)\u201cvalue\u201d of the tripping sensors will increase.This can be used to control the loco speed for a smooth and precise stop at a platform say. Commands IFGTE(CAM 013,8) SPEED(40)... IFGTE(CAM 013,16) SPEED(30) etc. can be used to control the loco approach speed with some precision. Finally, at the signal(S17), IFGTE(CAM 013,128) STOP</p> <p>Aliases could also be defined and used for station/bank or line sensors.e.g.IFGTE(TRENTHAM, 0x80)</p> <p>Example 2: The CAM can have up to 10 occupation/line detectors. If two\u201clinear\u201d line sensors are needed, and we have bank 1 allocated(S10-S17), the following 16 vPins could be assigned to 2 banks of linear sensors. We can use(bs#) ID of 20 to 27 for first linear sensor(bank2) and 30-37 of bank3. The Command Station can easily handle banks of 8, using an ID based format of(CAM 020) and(CAM 030).The\u201cbank\u201d or b/s notation requires the leading\u20180\u2019 on the bs No. for automatic vpin calculation. The linear segments at S21 to S27 may also be tested individually and a common bank threshold can be set if needed.e.g.IFGTE(CAM 020,1)...// bank occupied, or IFGTE(CAM 024,16)//2nd half occupied.</p> <p>Note: With\u20180\u2019 notation, unless you understand the issue, avoid using bank 8&amp; 9 as mistakes may arise.(08# must be expressed as 010# and 09# as 011# for correct outcome)</p>"},{"location":"products/ex-sensorcam/02-ex-sensor-manual/#2-multiple-cams","title":"2.

This is because the control of DC loco direction is relative to the TRACK and not the LOCO. (you turn a DC loco round on the track and it continues in the same geographical direction. You turn a DCC loco around and it continues to go forwards or backwards in the opposite geographical direction.)</p> <p>Generally DC tracks are wired so that two mainline tracks are in opposite direction which makes operation easy BUT crossovers between tracks will cause shorts unless you have very complex switching arrangements. This is generally incompatible with DCC wiring which expects to be able to cross between tracks with impunity because they are all wired with the same polarity.</p> <p>To get over this issue TM allows the polarity of a DC track to be swapped so that tracks wired for DCC may be switched to DC with a polarity chosen at run time according to your operations. So, for example, you may have two loops with a crossing between them. Normally you need them in opposite directions, but when you need to drive over the crossing, you need to switch one or other track so that they are at the same polarity.
