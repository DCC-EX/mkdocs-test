# Engine Driver - Adding a Physical Dial/Knob

While it is easy to use a BlueTooth gamepad with the **Engine Driver** app that doesn't allow for for a dial or slider.

It is possible to easily add a rotary dial (knob) to **Engine Driver** due its ability to control the throttle using the volume hardware buttons on the smart device (Phone / Tablet) and the ready availability of USB volume dials / knobs.
