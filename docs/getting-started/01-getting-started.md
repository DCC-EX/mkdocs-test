# Getting Started with DCC-EX

The DCC-Ex Command Station Booster 1 Express (CSB1) is a fully functioning Command Station. It is installed with our multifunctional software, which allows it to be used as shipped to run model trains.

There are 3 steps to operate the CSB1 as shipped. 

First, the operator must provide a DC power supply capable of providing clean power between 12 and 25 DC volts and 4 amps. The power supply connects to the CSB1 barrel jack. 

Second, the CSB1 must be connected securely to the track. The CSB1 track connector is labelled “A Main”. This connector is the furthest from the power supply barrel jack. 

Third, the operator must provide a CAB/Controller/Throttle to connect to the WIFI signal provided on the CSB1. There is an alternative CAB solution using a PC application, DCCEX-WiThrottle, to cable connect to the CSB1. Additional instructions are found on the Products pages.


The DCC-EX flagship product, EX CommandStation, can manage many popular accessories (like turnouts/points, signals, sensors to monitor activities on the layout, and feature animations. To add these features, it is appropriate to install the EX-Installer software upgrade application on a local PC. Instructions for installing and using the EX-Installer are found on the Products pages. 

The DCC-EX enterprise team offers a low-cost, build-it-yourself Command Station product that provides equivalent capabilities to the EX-Command Station. This product is also supported and described in detail in a later chapter.
